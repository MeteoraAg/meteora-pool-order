# Meteora Pool Sorting Order

Welcome to the Meteora Pool Sorting Order Repository. This repository contains a JSON file (`pool-order.json`) that defines the sorting order of AMM (Automated Market Maker) pools at [Meteora](https://app.meteora.ag/).

## JSON Structure

The `pool-order.json` file in this repository follows a specific structure to define the sorting order of Meteora pools. It is an array of pool addresses, where the order in the array dictates the sorting order on the Meteora platform. Pools listed at the beginning of the array will appear first in the sorting order. Below is an example of the JSON structure:

```json
[
  "32D4zRxNc1EssbJieVHfPhZM3rH6CzfUPrWUuWxD9prG",
  "4xqyRGWMRkfVo7GH74aryKjSLcpQiVHGAZY4u1n6wAbZ"
]
```

You can customize the `pool-order.json` file by adding or reordering pool addresses to suit your preferred sorting order on Meteora.

Feel free to make contributions to this repository to keep the pool sorting order up to date.
